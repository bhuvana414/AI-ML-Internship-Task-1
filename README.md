## 📂 Datasets Used  

### 🚢 Dataset 1: Titanic Dataset  

This dataset contains detailed information about Titanic passengers such as:  
- Gender  
- Passenger Class  
- Age  
- Fare  
- Survival Status  

Each row represents one passenger, and each column represents one feature.  
This dataset is mainly used for classification problems.

---

### 🎓 Dataset 2: Students Performance Dataset  

This dataset contains academic performance data of students, including:  
- Gender  
- Lunch type  
- Parental education  
- Test preparation status  
- Math, Reading, and Writing scores  

Each row represents one student, and each column represents one feature.  
This dataset is mainly used for regression and performance prediction problems.

## 🧭 Task Activities Performed  

### 📥 1️⃣ Dataset Loading  
- Loaded both datasets using Pandas  
- Displayed the first and last few rows to understand structure and columns  

---

### 🧩 2️⃣ Data Type Identification  

**Titanic Dataset**  
- Numerical Features: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch  
- Categorical Features: Sex, Embarked, Ticket, Cabin  
- Ordinal Features: Pclass  
- Binary Features: Survived  

**Students Performance Dataset**  
- Numerical Features: Math score, Reading score, Writing score  
- Categorical Features: Gender, Lunch, Parental Education, Test Preparation  

This classification helps in choosing suitable preprocessing and modeling techniques.

### 🔍 3️⃣ Data Inspection  
- Used df.info() to analyze data types, dataset size, and missing values  
- Used df.describe() to understand statistical summaries and data distribution  

---

### 🧪 4️⃣ Categorical Data Analysis  
- Checked unique values in categorical columns  
- Identified features requiring encoding before modeling  

---

### 🎯 5️⃣ Target Variable Identification  

**Titanic Dataset**  
- Target Variable: Survived  
- Input Features: All remaining columns  
- Problem Type: Binary Classification  

**Students Performance Dataset**  
- Target Variables:  
  - Math score  
  - Reading score  
  - Writing score  
- Problem Type: Regression  

---

### 📈 6️⃣ Dataset Suitability Analysis  
- Both datasets contain numerical and categorical features  
- Dataset sizes are sufficient for learning basic ML models  
- Suitable for ML after preprocessing  

---

### ⚠️ 7️⃣ Data Quality Observations  

**Titanic Dataset**  
- Missing values in Age and Cabin columns  
- Categorical features require encoding  
- Slight imbalance in the target variable  

**Students Performance Dataset**  
- No missing values  
- Categorical features require encoding  

---

## 📈 Final Outcome  
By completing this task, I gained a clear understanding of:
- Dataset structure and feature types  
- Differences between classification and regression datasets  
- Importance of data exploration before modeling  
- Identifying data quality issues  
- Preparing datasets for machine learning workflows
